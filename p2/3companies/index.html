      <h2>Company #1: Flaming Ponds</h2>
      <p>Flaming Ponds is a candle company offering a wide variety of candles in varying sizes, scents, and colors to put into your home. Despite the scary name the inventory would focus on comforting scented candles with classics such as warm vanilla, cinnamon, lavender, and fresh linen scents. The scent would come in three sizes each, a three wick, a two wick, and a smaller single wick candle option. </p>
      <h2>Company #2: Lil Miss Lollipop</h2>
      <p> Lil Miss Lollipop is a company focused on specifically selling lollipops, and lollipops only. They would offer a wide variety of brands which you can click on, then select a flavor directly from that brand. They would also offer mystery bags that have a wide variety of different flavors in brands in a single order. You can order gift sets as well that are color or flavor coded to match any special event. 
      <h2>Company #1: nannerB.</h2>
      <p>nannerB is a seller focused only on things that are scented like freshly baked banana bread. This niche company would have a limited inventory and literally would only appeal to a select amount of people. Their inventory would include a small array of items such as scented candles, essential oils, perfumes, air fresheners, and bathbombs. However, they are up to critiques on what else they may be able to add to their stock. </p>
