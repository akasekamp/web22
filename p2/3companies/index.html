      <h2>Company #1: Flaming Ponds</h2>
      <p>Flaming Ponds is a candle company offering a wide variety of candles in varying sizes, scents, and colors to put into your home. Despite the scary name the inventory would focus on comforting scented candles with classics such as warm vanilla, cinnamon, lavender, and fresh linen scents. The scent would come in three sizes each, a three wick, a two wick, and a smaller single wick candle option. </p>
      <h2>Company #2: Lil Miss Lollipop</h2>
      <p> Lil Miss Lollipop is a modern candy company that sells a wide variety of sweet treats. Their inventory includes an array of candies including lollipops, gummy bears, fun chocolates, old time hard candies, and international candy favorites from across the world. 
      <h2>Company #3: nannerB.</h2>
      <p>nannerB is a seller focused only on things that are scented like freshly baked banana bread. This niche company would have a limited inventory and literally would only appeal to a select amount of people. Their inventory would include a small array of items such as scented candles, essential oils, perfumes, air fresheners, and bathbombs. However, they are up to critiques on what else they may be able to add to their stock. </p>
