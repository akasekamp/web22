      <h2>Idea #1: The Volkswagen Beetle</h2>
      <p>If you've known me for any amount of time, you know I am an avid car enthusiast who drives a Volkswagen beetle. I chose this topic because it really interests me and I already have a hefty amount of knowledge on the subject. I am thinking the five sections of the webpage would cover the following: the concept of the beetle, the production of the car, the different models over the years, influence on popular culture, and where it is today. This would cover pretty much the full history while also covering interesting information such as its influence on culture and the car community in general.</p>
      <h2>Idea #2: The Chocolate Chip Cookie</h2>
      <p>Ah, the beloved chocolate chip cookie. Everyone knows what that is and almost everyone loves to eat them. As the manager of a cookie bakery and an avid at-home baker, I have a lot of knowledge and passion for chocolate chip cookies. If I were to cover this topic, the five sections would be as follows: What is the definition of chocolate chip cookie, where did it come from, how was the recipe originally created, how has the cookie evolved over time, and offer the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies. </p>
      <h2>Idea #3: Ehlers Danlos Syndrome</h2>
      <p>Going in a different direction, I would do a medical website about the rare disease known as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. I would do this in an attempt to be an advocate and bring awareness to the medical community. As I actively suffer from this disease every day, I have an excellent amount of knowledge on the subject. This website would be telling the story of the disease, the sections would include information on: what is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, what causes this syndrome, symptoms and side effects of it, treatments and hope for the future, and I would add some resources of where to get more information and support for people who are in need or curious. </p>
